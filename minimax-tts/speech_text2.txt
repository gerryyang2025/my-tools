Dear Colleagues, We are kicking off the 2025 Employee Satisfaction Survey — a chance for you to help make X an even better place to work. It's an opportunity for you to share your thoughts, and for us to pinpoint and address issues. It helps all of us to raise the bar and ensure X remains a top-tier, innovative organization. Over the past year, our focus has been on optimizing products to foster growth in various business areas. However, the rapid rise and evolution of AI present uncertainties. We must stay clear-headed and listen to frontline teams and ourselves to identify issues, seize AI opportunities, improve efficiency, and achieve high-quality growth. In 2024, employee satisfaction scores in compensation, communication, and the company's future increased significantly, while scores people gave to their own department's future, collaboration, trust, and creative areas still need improvement.
